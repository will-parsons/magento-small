  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to Magento Community Edition, the [Magento User
  Guide](http://www.magentocommerce.com/resources/user-guide-download) will
  step you through the process of configuring and managing your store. This
  guide is free, but does require you to provide a valid email address to
  receive it.

  After the stack has been created, you can find the admin username and
  password listed in the "Credentials" section of Stack Details.

  The [Magento Forum](http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/) provides a place
  to get answers to both simple and advanced questions regarding configuration
  and management of Magento Community Edition.

  #### Logging into Magento
  To login, go to the URL listed above in a browser. If your DNS is not
  pointing to this installation, you can add a line in your [hosts
  file](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-modify-my-hosts-file)
  to point your domain to the IP of this Cloud Server. Once you've done this,
  restart your browser and navigate to the site. The backend can be accessed using the
  "Magento Admin URL" listed in Stack Details, and you can login with the credentials
  provided in the "Credentials" section of Stack Details.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  To update or upload code, you can log in as the 'magento' user via SSH or SFTP
  into the 'httpdocs' folder. The password is provided n the "Credentials"
  section of Stack Details.

  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH, which should be used for configuration changes only.
  We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/).  Once
  the deployment is up, Ansible will not run again unless you update the
  stack. **Any changes made to the configuration may be overwritten when the
  stack is updated.**

  [Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/) is used as the web server and listens on port
  80 to handle web traffic. The configuration for your site can be
  found in /etc/nginx/conf.d/. There will be a default site
  configuration and a separate one for your domain. Magento itself is
  installed in /var/www/vhosts. You will find a directory with the name of
  website you entered as a part of this deployment.

  [PHP-FPM](http://php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php) is used to handle
  evaluation of all PHP-based pages. The configuration for this installation is
  based on the URL of your site, and can be found within
  /etc/php5/fpm/pools/yoursite.conf.  Nginx is configured to send Magento Admin
  Dashboard trafic to a second PHP-FPM pool for better memory management.

  Magento cache and and session storage are handled by
  [Redis](http://redis.io/). Redis is an in-memory, high performance key-value
  and is used for caching data and persisting user session data. This enhances
  the performance of your site by reducing expensive database calls. Three
  caches are configured: two for data caching and one for session persistence.
  You can find the configuration of these caches in /etc/redis/.

  The Redis instances are running on the Primary server, and relevant Magento
  configuration is under:
   . app/etc/cache.xml
   . app/etc/modules/Cm_RedisSession.xml
  If you plan to replace the default Magento codebase with your own store, you
  should take a copy of these files for reference.


  MySQL is being hosted on a Cloud Database instance.
  Backups for MySQL are provided by [Holland](http://wiki.hollandbackup.org/),
  which is running on the Primary web server.

  Backups are configured using Cloud Backups.  The Primary server is configured
  to back up /var/spool/holland and /var/www once per week, and to retain
  these backups for 30 days.

  In order to restore the Database from backup, you will need to first restore
  /var/spool/holland from the appropriate Cloud Backup.  After you have done so,
  you will need to log into the Primary server and restore the Holland backup
  to the Cloud Database via the MySQL client.  For more assistance, please
  contact your Support team.

  Monitoring is configured to verify that Nginx is running on both the Primary
  and all secondary servers, as well as that the Cloud Load Balancer is
  functioning.  Additionally, the default CPU, RAM, and Filesystem checks
  are in place on all servers.

  ### Notes for multi-server deployments
  On the secondary servers, Nginx is configured to sent all Magento Admin
  Dashboard traffic to the Primary web server; (proxy_pass if adminhtml cookie
  is present.) This avoids the need to use a separate DNS subdomain for your
  Admin traffic, and ensures all new content, such as product images, are
  uploaded to the Primary server.

  [Lsyncd](https://github.com/axkibe/lsyncd) has been installed in order to
  sync static content from the Primary server to all secondary servers.
  When uploading content, it only needs to be uploaded to the Primary node,
  and will be automatically synchronized to all secondary nodes.

  ### SSL Certificates
  Using SSL is highly recommended. You can enable SSL by uploading your
  certificate to the Cloud Load Balancer, which is configurable under Network ->
  Cloud Load Balancers. Once it is set up, you can set your Frontend and Admin
  use https:// base URLs. Please call Support for further guidance, or if your
  actions lead to broken or looping redirects.

  #### Magento Plugins
  There are thousands of plugins that have been developed for Magento by the
  developer community. [Magento
  Connect](http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/) provides an easy
  way to discover popular plugins that other users have found to be helpful.
  Not all plugins are free, and we recommend only installing the plugins that
  you need.

  #### Additional Notes
  You can add additional servers to this deployment by updating the
  "server_count" parameter for this stack.  This deployment is
  intended for low to medium traffic production websites and can be
  scaled as needed to accommodate future growth.

  When scaling this deployment by adjusting the "server_count" parameter,
  make sure that you DO NOT change the "database_flavor" and "database_disk"
  parameters, as this will result in the loss of all data within the
  database.

  #### Important security notes
  The Magento code provided here is the latest at time of deployment, but
  Magento does *not* auto-update. You, or your development team, are responsible
  for applying any and all future Magento security patches to keep your site
  secure. For awareness, we would highly recommend signing up to recieve
  security alerts at https://magento.com/security

  #### Uploading your existing Magento Website
  If you already have an existing Magento website to import to this solution,
  you should select the "Do not install Magento" option under Advanced Options,
  and follow these steps.

  #####1. Code upload

  Use the `magento` SSH credentials to upload your code and content, via SFTP,
  into to the `~/httpdocs` directory on the primary web server. The *LsyncD*
  will synchronise content to any secondary servers.

  #####2. Database import

  Upload your database dump to the master server with the `magento` SSH
  credentials. Put in in the home directory, above httpdocs, so that it's not
  accessible over the web. We've set up credentials in the `~/.my.cnf` for you
  to easily use the mysql command line client. The database will be called
  `magento`.

  Log on via SSH as the 'magento' user, and import with:

  ```mysql magento < your-database-dump.sql```
  or, if it's compressed:
  ```zcat your-database-dump.sql.gz | mysql magento```

  This can typically take up to 20 minutes, depending on your database size.

  > Alternatively, you could use the MySQL Workbench or similar, using
  > "TCP/IP over SSH". First use the `magento` SSH credentials for the SSH
  > tunnel, then the Cloud Database hostname and MySQL credentials.


  #####3. Magento Database configuration

  Modify your `app/etc/local.xml` file with the Cloud Database details. The
  database name is `magento`and the database username is `magento`. The hostname
  will be your unique `xxxxx.rackspaceclouddb.com` host, and the password can be
  found in the Stack Credentials and also in your `~/.my.cnf` file on the
  primary web server.

  #####4. Magento sessions + cache configuration

  This step is *essential* for performance, and for the correct operation of
  multi-server setups.

  You should find the necessary config under `~/httpdocs/app/etc/cache.xml`,
  which will be included by Magento if kept in that directory. If this has been
  overwritten or removed by your version control or, you should also find the
  details in `~/cache.xml`, which you can include in your `local.xml`.

  There are multiple Redis instances running on the primary web server for
  Magento sessions and Magento cache backend. Note that in order to use Redis
  for sessions, you will also need to modify
  `app/etc/modules/Cm_RedisSession.xml` and set `<active>` to "true" . The
  fallback is to use the database.

  Please do contact Rackspace support if you need assistance here, or if you'd
  like to discuss using the highly available ObjectRocket platform for Redis.

  #####5. Final steps

  - You may wish to disable Magento's automatic redirection, in order to access
  the Admin dashboard for testing and URL configuration.

  > Log on via SSH as the 'magento' user, then you can set that with:
  >
  >     mysql magento -e 'UPDATE core_config_data SET value=0 WHERE path="web/url/redirect_to_base"';

  - Delete all files under `httpdocs/var/cache` left over from any
     previous environments.

  - If we can help at any stage, please don't hesitate to call
     Rackspace Support and our Magento experts will be happy to advise on
     all aspects of your deployment.
